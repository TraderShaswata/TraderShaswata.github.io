An intervention that could help people make healthier food & beverage choices is to have front-of-package food labelling, like FSSAI proposed in their 2018 draft paper. Indicate fat, sugar, & salt per serving, & a warning if per serving % is beyond a % of daily requirement.

Also maybe a recommended maximum number of servings per day. Even the healthiest foods on the planet are healthy only when consumed in moderation. To know more on [food labels and rating.](https://finshots.in/archive/a-star-rating-for-packed-food/)
