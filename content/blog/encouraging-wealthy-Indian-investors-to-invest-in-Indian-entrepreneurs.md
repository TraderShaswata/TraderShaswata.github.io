UK offers 50% tax relief & capital gains exemption for startup investments. This seems a great way to incentivize wealthy to invest in startups.
We maybe need similar schemes to reduce our dependency on foreign VCs & better use our local wealth stuck in Gold, Real estate & FDs.

The biggest problem to solve in India is to spread wealth inclusively & not just in the top 1%.

This is possible only when wealth creation can be captured by a large subset of Indians when Indian businesses do well. Today, most wealth gets captured outside India.

We have to nudge Indian retail investors to move some of their assets from FDs, gold, and real estate to back Indian entrepreneurs and maybe help the country grow inclusively. This is what excites us at Zerodha and even at Rainmatter.
