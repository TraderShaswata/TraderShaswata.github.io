description: Startups and small businesses end up spending a lot of money wastefully on Google ads on their brand name keywords. Hopefully, the recent Delhi HC order prohibiting brands from doing this might set a precedent...

The only time we ran Google ads was when our competition ran ads when people searched for Zerodha. We ran ads against "zerodha(.)competition(.)com". Our lamest expenditure to date. Hoping this order is a precedent & helps startups save on unnecessary costs
