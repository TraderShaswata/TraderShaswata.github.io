Maybe it has nothing to do with being founders, & it's just human nature that absolute success isn’t as satisfying as relative success. As you do or make more, you get into bubbles where you benchmark yourself to those who have more, and you want it. So that chase never ends?

It's accentuated with famous folks & successful founders seeking constant validation. It's crazy how people around me think I have answers to all life's problems just because of whatever little success I've had. It's quite tough to not get carried away & start believing in it.
