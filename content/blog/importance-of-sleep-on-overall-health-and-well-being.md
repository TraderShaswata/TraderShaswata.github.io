The number of people having severe heart issues in my extended circle is terrifying. The common thread seems to be sleep deprivation, and not nearly enough is spoken about the importance of sleep on overall health & well-being. The problem has gotten worse post-COVID & WFH. 

If you, like me, have trouble sleeping because of constant work distractions, triggers from email, news apps, social media, and chats, disconnecting completely—I mean full cold turkey—a few hours before sleep helps significantly. 

Killing work chats after 6 PM  at Zerodha has helped everyone, including me, quite a bit. I'm now trying to turn off the phone by evening. I keep reminding myself that it is supposed to be Business & not Busy-ness. Being constantly busy ironically means less productivity.
