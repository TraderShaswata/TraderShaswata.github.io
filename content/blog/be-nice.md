If there was one life lesson that I could share, it would be: Nice guys never finish last. Your odds of getting lucky in a connected world like ours dramatically go up when you have people genuinely wishing you well.

People root for you when you are [genuinely nice](https://twitter.com/morganhousel/status/1457378391284281345?s=20) to everyone you interact with without any expectation. It doesn't matter if it's a teammate, customer or a stranger. It doesn't matter if you are working for someone or running a business.
