Thanks for the acknowledgment [Bill Gates](https://twitter.com/BillGates). All our giving forward initiatives are mostly thanks to the team at [Rainmatter Foundation](https://twitter.com/RainmatterOrg)

In this journey, we're at that place where we're also still building up Zerodha. Kailash building  tech and I managing the overall business, and both of us giving some time to Rainmatter, while 
[Nikhil](https://twitter.com/nikhilkamathcio) manages investments.

We are incredibly lucky to be in a position to be able to give forward or invest for future. We were lucky to be at the right place and at the right time with the right products & initiatives when the markets grew quickly in the last few years. 

This made it possible for us to think about the future and start supporting and partnering with organizations that are tackling pressing issues. This was along with the entrepreneurs we were already backing through [Rainmatter](https://twitter.com/Rainmatterin). 

Knowing that the upside from everything we do also is some way helping the society is what keeps all of us going as a team. A reason to get up every morning and continue working.

Thanks for taking the time to meet us. You are an inspiration.
