A [Tradingqna](https://tradingqna.com/) user pointed to a video of Ramesh Damani where he says, Trading is always done by slip book & not chequebook & asked what it meant. 
Ramesh explains this other version of maybe the most important rule in trading & life, Cut your losers & Hold on to the winners. 

Thanks, Ramesh, for taking the time to share the response to my cold email. ðŸ˜ƒ Here is [the link to the full post](https://tradingqna.com/t/trading-is-always-done-with-slip-book-not-cheque-book/147373/5?u=bhuvan).

Most retail traders lose money because they do the opposite, i.e., cut winners & hold on to the losers, a guaranteed way to lose money trading.
This is because traders let their egos get in the way, or they have too much money at stake, which makes them behave irrationally.
