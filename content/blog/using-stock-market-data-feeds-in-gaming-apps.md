Today, YourStory shared that NSE issued a cease and desist letter to all stock gaming apps. We had written about this issue on the [Rainmatter blog](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/rainmatter/stock-trading-games-copy-trading-platforms-in-india) that using exchange data feeds for gaming involving money is an issue, since regulations don't allow it. 

When regulations aren't explicit or clear, it's always better to do things in a regulatorily appropriate way, or always better to assume that you are regulated and do things that regulators would expect.
