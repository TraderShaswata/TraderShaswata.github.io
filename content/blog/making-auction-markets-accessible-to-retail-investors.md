If you actively trade, you would've faced a short delivery and a large auction penalty at least once. Such penalties are due to illiquid auction markets.

We are now trying to improve liquidity in auctions by [allowing our customers to participate](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/tradezerodha/kite/you-can-now-participate-in-auction-markets).

Short delivery happens when the seller doesn't deliver the shares. This can happen if: 
1. Stocks sold for intraday hit an upper circuit.
2. Buy today, sell tomorrow (BTST) traders don't deliver.
3. Failure to deliver shares to cover physical delivery of F&O. 

To settle short-delivered trades, exchanges conduct a 30-minute auction from 2 PM on T+1 (used to be T+2).
If the short-delivered stock is a mid or small-cap stock, then the price can trade as much as 20% away from the current market price due to low participation in auctions
 
Now that you can participate in auctions, they are also an opportunity to make a risk-free profit if there is a price difference. This will also improve liquidity, ensuring that traders stuck with short delivery positions don't lose a lot due to an auction penalty.
