Finally, in some good news for options writers, ICAI has clarified that when calculating turnover to determine tax audit, only the profit or loss has to be considered. No need to separately add the premium received when writing options as turnover.

Here is [the link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lDHZmh7X3a3WASRfjLJ_PsOwfCBAwbTH/view) to the guidance note (page 17).

We have updated the [Varsity chapter on taxation](https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/turnover-balance-sheet-and-pl/). We will update our tax P&L statements to show option turnover as per the guidance note in a few days.

Hopefully,  the audit requirements when online trading is the only business income are also simplified soon. 
 
Trading isn’t like running a normal business, and audit requirements are onerous for retail investors. Hence, most traders avoid declaring when filing ITR.
