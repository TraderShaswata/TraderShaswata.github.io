Happy Independence day ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³. Coincidentally it's [Zerodha's 11th birthday today too](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/featured/11-years-of-zerodha).ðŸ˜€ If I were to look back, we are most proud of building a business that continues to innovate, & prioritise customer interest over business growth constantly. 

We're also proud of the part we continue to play in growing the capital market ecosystem in India through [Rainmatterin](https://rainmatter.com) and give back to society through our foundation [RainmatterOrg](https://rainmatter.org). 

There's plenty for us to get better at, especially around our support. We've made drastic changes which are already showing great results in terms of our response times. 
Also, check the post for a recap of our product updates from last year.

All of this wouldnâ€™t have been possible without your love and support. So thank you for your constant encouragement and for pushing us to do better.
