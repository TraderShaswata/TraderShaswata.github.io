Insurance unfortunately needs to be hard sold today. The issue is that most donâ€™t understand why they need insurance. Even if they do, it's tough to find unbiased advice. There's just too much choice, complexity, mis-selling, & not to mention spam. Scares away most people.

Even at home, dad has bought a lot of horrible policies as investments vs insurance over the years. We have always wanted to do something about this problem. We knew technology alone isn't the answer. You need a human with the right incentives & no conflicts on the other side. 

When the boys at [Finshots](finshots.in/), pitched the idea of solving for it [through Ditto](https://joinditto.in). It was one of those neki aur puch puch moment for us.ðŸ˜¬Our bet is that if you can educate folks about why insurance, and guide them, sales will happen on their own & organically.
