At current rates, T-bills & G-secs are much better than a bank FD. 

Most people still don't know that you can easily buy T-bills & G-Secs on exchanges/your trading a/c without CSGL etc. 

Btw, they're open for investing every Monday on [@CoinByZerodha](https://twitter.com/CoinByZerodha) [https://coin.zerodha.com/gsec](https://coin.zerodha.com/gsec)
