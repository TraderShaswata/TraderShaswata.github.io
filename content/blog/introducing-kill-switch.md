When you're in a drawdown while trading, the best thing to do is to take a break. Otherwise, the chances of you being irrational, taking large bets, overtrading & blowing up are high. And to nudge you to do just that, [we now have a “Kill Switch”](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/nudge/introducing-kill-switch). 

Enabling the Kill switch will instantly disable trading. Currently, this is manual. But we are working on automating this where you can set a maximum loss. Hitting this will trigger the Kill Switch instantly and disable trading in your account so that you can take a break.

I think taking a break when things aren’t going well can be super helpful in all aspects of life.   And launching products & features that I wanted as a trader built by our amazing tech team, is the best part of my life Zerodha. I feel like a kid in a candy store.
