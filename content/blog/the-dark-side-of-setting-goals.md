We've [never set goals](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/node/149894) at Zerodha, be it user growth, revenues, or profits. The idea has been to get up every day, improve, & do what's right for users, knowing that we'll get to wherever we have to get to. The journey is a lot more fun this way. 

In any case, the range of outcomes in business is mostly driven by luck and being at the right place at the right time. Sharing so that people know that there are multiple ways to build a decently large business.
