There's at least Rs 80,000 crores of unclaimed money across Banks, Mutual funds, Demats, & more. 

We are hoping [this alert feature which notifies nominees](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/console/introducing-online-nomination) when accounts become dormant & they don't reKYC, can help in solving this problem. 

Hopefully, the Banks & others follow.
