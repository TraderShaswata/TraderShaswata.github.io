Life is like a marathon, and you need to be able to finish strong. Physical and mental health are among the most important aspects in life. You can't buy good health with all the money in the world.

I try to get a workout first thing in the morning with Seema; it also acts like our bonding exercise. ðŸ˜€ A workout first thing also means I make better choices with food throughout the day.

As for the mind, I try to talk about whatever is bothering me. Postponing this almost always makes it worse. Having hobbies like music and sports means I also get to spend time with myself, which helps a lot.

We also get regular health checkups. Nothing in life can guarantee perfect health. Regular checkups help you spot issues early and act on them. This is the best we can do.

It was super fun talking about all of this along with [the brother](https://twitter.com/nikhilkamathcio) on his podcast along with [Sunil Shetty](https://twitter.com/SunielVShetty) and [Mukesh Bansal](https://twitter.com/mukeshbansal06)

And yeah, Nik and I are are two different people. It's ridiculous how many people think we are the same personðŸ˜¬

Nik is the best trader I know, he manages public market investments at Zerodha, runs this awesome podcast, and does a bunch of other things. I run the business as CEO of Zerodha and manage Zerodhaâ€™s private investments through Rainmatter.
