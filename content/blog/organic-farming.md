I keep asking everyone who’s adopted organic farming if yields drop after they stopped using chemicals.
In a world where short term gains trump long term improvements, it's tough to see how the shift to organic — even if good for the planet, would happen if yields are lower.

In May, Sri Lanka banned chemical fertiliser and pesticides & went fully organic. There's been an uproar over this move. Some people and groups have even blamed this move for the food crisis there. [This piece explains why that's maybe wrong](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/sri-lanka-goes-organic-318938#.YVhtYnCdeVA.twitter). 

At [Rainmatter Foundation](https://rainmatter.org), we work with Swayyam, [Organic Mandya](organicmandya.com) & [AkshayaKalpa](https://akshayakalpa.org). They've shown that organic farming if done right, is not only good for the soil, biodiversity, creation of livelihood, & health but also stable yields. More importantly, farmers are more resilient.
