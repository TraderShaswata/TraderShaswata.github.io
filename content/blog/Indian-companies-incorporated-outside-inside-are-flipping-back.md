Happy to see many companies building for India incorporated outside, flipping back. While some are for regulatory reasons, but mostly for conducive IPO markets here.
For India to become wealthy inclusively, wealth creation from successful businesses has to happen at home.

If wealth created by leveraging Indian resources doesn't stay back home, how will we ever be a $5 trillion economy & more?
Hoping India can do whatever it takes to be attractive for companies to incorporate hereâ€”from the ease of running a business to raising capital to go IPO
