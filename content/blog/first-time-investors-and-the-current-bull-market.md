Unlike the previous bull runs, most of the new investors starting especially because of IPOs this time are under 30 years. The good thing is that they are younger and have less to invest. Meaning they can learn hands-on and bounce back quicker if money mistakes are made. 

Historically, activity has always dropped sharply post serious market falls. Folks who have significant investments typically don't do anything in such markets. It will be interesting to see how the new young investors with small ticket sizes behave this time around.

IPOs have played a huge role in attracting these users. Without UPI for IPOs, it wouldn't have been possible for non-bank brokerage firms like us. India Stack has probably been responsible for a lion's share of disruption and innovation in India Fintech.
