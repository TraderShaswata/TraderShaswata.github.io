At Zerodha, we have just killed all work-related chats post 6 pm & holidays. Also trying to get as many conversations to be asynchronous, moving them from chat to our internal instance of [Discourse](http://discourse.com). Curious to see if this helps reduce the feeling of burnt out & brain fried. Apparently, multitasking hurts performance and may even damage the brain (check the link below). Being part of multiple discussions on different topics in different chat groups simultaneously (Multitasking) [has gone up exponentially](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27042151) post WFH.
