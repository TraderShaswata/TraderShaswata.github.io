I still remember the formula for the area of a circle or that CH3OH is Methanol from school.
Similarly, If we taught finance basics in school, like why start investing early, inflation, insurance, retirement planning, etc. These lessons will be helpful throughout life.  

Thanks, Tejasvi Surya, for bringing this up at the parliament. We have the experience of running [Zerodha Varsity](https://zerodha.com/varsity), amongst the largest free educational platforms on financial education. [Karthik Rangappa](https://twitter.com/karthikrangappa) and I would love to help the Ministry of Eduction in any way.
