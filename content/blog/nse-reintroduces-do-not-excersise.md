The Do Not Exercise (DNE) facility for stock options is [reintroduced from this expiry onwards](https://tradingqna.com/t/nse-has-reintroduced-dne-do-not-exercise-form-april-28th-2022/129638). The removal of DNE had [increased the risk of losses](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/queries/stock-and-fo-queries/physical-delivery-of-stock-fo-their-risks) for traders if OTM options suddendly became ITM.
