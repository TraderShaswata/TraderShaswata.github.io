In my limited startup experience, paid is much [easier](https://twitter.com/RWW/status/1556404073158660097) than earned or owned, & super addictive. If businesses spend to grow, they rarely pivot from paid to focus on earned or owned unless, of course, they're running out of funds. Word of mouth is more valuable than anything paid.
