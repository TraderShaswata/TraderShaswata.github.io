From Feb 2022, the T+1 settlement cycle will be introduced in a phased manner in the Indian markets. The biggest benefit: You can withdraw funds within 1 day when you sell stocks. We'll be the 2nd large market in the world to move to T+1, kudos to SEBI for pushing this.

Why isn't it possible for T+0 or Instant settlement like UPI? Unlike bank transfers where it's money, stocks & money to be settled. Also, most trades daily are intraday, folks selling shares without actually holding them [which makes it tricky.](https://tradingqna.com/t/introduction-of-t-1-rolling-settlement-on-an-optional-basis/118205/20)
