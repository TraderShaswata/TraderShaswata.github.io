What's it like being a CEO in a songðŸ˜¬

Jab Koi Baat Bigad Jaaye, Jab Koi Mushkil Pad Jaaye
Tum Dena Saath Mera, O Humnawaaz
Ho Chaandni Jab Tak Raat, Deta Hai Har Koi Saath
Tum Magar Andheron Mein, Na Chhodna Mera Haath
[This & more with Chandra Srikanth.](https://youtu.be/P_oiv_cnYy4) 

I was forced to translate this for my non-Hindi speaking colleagues. ðŸ¥¶

If something goes wrong, When going gets tough
Stand by me, oh my love
When there is moonlight, Everyone sticks around
When there is darkness, Donâ€™t leave my hand
