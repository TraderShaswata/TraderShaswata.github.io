Our capital market infrastructure & regulations don't get enough credit for being among the best in the world.
 
It is crazy & scary what is happening today in the Crypto world. Crypto Brokers & exchanges can act as banks in most markets, exposing customers to unlimited risk. 

In India, all securities are held by the customer at the depository. All unused funds are sent back monthly/qtrly and one client's funds can't be used to fund another.
 
In most markets, brokers can hold customer securities & funds indefinitely & use them any way they want.

Like we celebrate our payment systems for being the best, we also need to do the same for our market infrastructure. Especially SEBI, for whatever they have done to protect retail investor interests by continuously reducing risks & marking our markets safer.
