Like many, I had never cared or questioned how my milk is sourced until I started talking to Shashi from Akshayakalpa. Cows that are always tied down, tend to catch diseases fast & the use of antibiotics becomes a necessity. This ultimately shows up in the milk & our bodies.

Scientists & health orgs have long highlighted the serious threat of antibiotic resistance to health & food security. The continued misuse of antibiotics in animals & humans is making this worse. This issue isn't just with diary, but with the poultry & meat industry as well.
