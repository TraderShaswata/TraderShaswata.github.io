description: If traders make money quickly with bad behavior, they mostly lose it just as quickly...

[The one important thing from this that I want everyone trading to know](https://youtu.be/b31EfvTmklU) is that if traders make money quickly with bad behavior, they mostly lose it just as quickly. Money management, which most don't focus on, is exponentially more important than buy/sell signals & strategies.

In the last 20yrs, I havenâ€™t seen anyone who has kept profits from trading without good risk management. I know many who've lost quickly. The fastest was a client, who turned Rs 1lk to Rs 2 cr in 2 days buying deep OTM puts in 2008 but gave it all back in the next 12 months.

There is no quick money that can be made & kept. The most important aspect of trading is to never be in a situation where a trade can cause more than a 1 to 5% loss of capital. Lesser the better. That is when greed & fear will lead to the least stupidity as well.
