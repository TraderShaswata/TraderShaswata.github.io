I was at an amazing Micro, Small, & Medium enterprises (MSME) event hosted by [Rajiv Talreja](https://twitter.com/rajivtalreja). One lesson I had to share.
Today's world is about the fast beating the slow, not the big beating the small like in the past. So being small & hence fast is an edge, not a disadvantage.

While Zerodha might seem large, we are still an MSME at heart. MSMEs today face many challenges like access to capital, credit etc. But the only way for India to grow inclusively is to have a thriving MSME ecosystem.
