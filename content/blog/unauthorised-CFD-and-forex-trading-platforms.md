[We had cautioned people about illegal CFD & Forex & Binary trading platforms](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/sticky/the-twisted-world-of-illegal-cfds-binary-options) a while back, but I still keep seeing those ads, which means people still losing money. Today's RBI press release will hopefully put an end to these illegal platforms.  The RBI circular also reiterates that trading derivatives on international exchanges with funds sent through LRS is not permitted.
