Not all of it is for investing, but still. This status-quo bias could mean over Rs 1 lakh crores annually, if 3% more on SB rate.

For businesses starting off, it is essential to optimize returns wherever possible. We [wrote this](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/rainmatter/a-quick-guide-to-cash-management-for-startups) recently.
