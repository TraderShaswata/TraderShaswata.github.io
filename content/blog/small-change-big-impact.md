88% homes have a fan while 72% have a mattress.
97% of fans are energy inefficient, this can now change with a [new rating system.](https://finshots.in/archive/the-ceiling-fan-revolution/)
If Indians switched to efficient fans, Govt can save ₹575Cr & homes ₹6000/year
Small change, big impact. Even for our planet
