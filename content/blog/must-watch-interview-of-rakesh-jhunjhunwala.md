[This RJ chat is a must-watch](https://youtu.be/2LCUse19lbk)
1. The common thing among successful traders & entrepreneurs is to always think in terms of risk to reward. They take a trade—buy a stock or take a business bet—only if they've made peace with the worst possible outcome

2. An understanding that leverage (debt) is merciless & a double-edged sword. If at all they need to use leverage, it's only a small portion of their networth. That's how they survive the bad days.

3. The ability to be patient when it's the hardest.
