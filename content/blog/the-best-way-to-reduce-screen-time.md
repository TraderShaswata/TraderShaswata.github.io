The best strategy with diet is to eat healthier foods first; you'll automatically reduce eating the bad stuff.
Similarly, best way to limit screen time is to add non-screen experiences. For me, the only true [digital detox](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-02-23/craving-a-marc-benioff-style-digital-detox-good-luck) is playing a physical sport.

"As with any bad habit, perhaps the best way to break it isnâ€™t to put our energy into resisting the siren song, but into singing a different tune. In a self-regulation society, that might be the best we can do."
