Whenever I get asked if [@zerodhaonline](https://twitter.com/zerodhaonline) or the Indian broking industry will continue to grow at the same pace, I refer to Robinhood, which is a good proxy.

US markets are down ~30% and monthly active users are down ~50%. The activity is back to pre-pandemic levels.
