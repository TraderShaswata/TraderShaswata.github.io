Watching famous personalities with huge fan followings trying to trigger their fans or retail investors to invest in super risky asset classes without talking about the risks, or caring about the risk profile of those who follow them is quite disgusting. 

Thanks to Crypto, it's been a case of "never meet your heroes,‚Äù with so many people I admired for peddling crypto, NFTs, etc. as safe & guaranteed. Nothing against Crypto, it would have been the same if stocks or even AAA-rated debt was peddled as being safe & guaranteed.
