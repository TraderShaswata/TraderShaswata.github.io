description: App permissions Zerodha apps ask for...
---
Report by Kotak on various finance apps & permissions they ask for. Btw Kite, [Coin](https://coin.zerodha.com), & [Zerodha Varsity](zerodha.com/varsity/) don't ask for any permissions to run. The apps ask for access to photos in case a user wants to set a profile picture. Hopefully, we never have to get into lending.
