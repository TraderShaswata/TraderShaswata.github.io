We use [Listmonk](https://listmonk.app) built by our very own Dr K Smiling face with open mouth, to send 30mil emails/month at ~$200. It would have cost us tens of 000's $/month otherwise. One of the main reasons for our high margins, profitability, & hence ability to bootstrap is because almost everything we use is FOSS.

K & our tech team also contribute back to FOSS (Free & Open Source Software) significantly. K built Listmonk as a hobby project to solve our email problems. He then open-sourced it for people to build on. Here are [some of our FOSS contributions](https://zerodha.tech/projects/).
