Not getting consumed by social media while trying to build an audience has been one of the toughest things I have done in my life.
The dopamine hit from likes & shares is extremely addictive. Social media platforms have done an amazing job of engineering us to feel this way.

I keep reminding myself that if the quality of content goes down, so will that of the audience. To keep in check the need to say something even when there isn't.
Sharing this as a note to myself and also to an extremely smart friend who seems to be missing the point.ðŸ˜ƒ
