We are stoked about the [new tagging feature on Console](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/console/tagging-on-console-trading-journal-tracking-goals). Tagging your trades and maintaining a trading journal can help you become a better trader and also help you track your investment goals.

You can't become a better trader if you don't learn from your mistakes. But in order to learn, you need a proper journal of all your trades and the reasons you took the trades. You can then look back, review, and do more of what is working & less of what isn't.

Most traders don't maintain a journal because it takes some effort to tag trades, take notes & track P&L. This was a personal problem for me back when I was trading. So I'm super excited to announce the launch of Console tags which helps you easily journal your trades.

We could then potentially also nudge or alert if a particular type of tag is being used while order placement if it hasn't been profitable historically. This is next on our list of things to do with the Tagging Nudge.
