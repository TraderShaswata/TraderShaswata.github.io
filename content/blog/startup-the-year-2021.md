Thanks, Business Standard and the jury, for the acknowledgement. [When we win these awards,](https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/bs-annual-awards-2021-stellar-jury-picks-the-best-of-india-inc-122032801495_1.html) we get asked, is still a startup? I guess being a startup in todayâ€™s world is a state of mind and not just age. In that sense, we hopefully can remain a startup forever.
