[Elephants by the lake or EBTL](https://ebtl.earth) was Rainmatter Foundation's first experiment to regenerate ~70 acres of land adjoining a forest not far from Bengaluru. We hope to create an open playbook that can be replicated elsewhere to create many more EBTLs.

Make sure to read the brilliant project updates by Team Ananas, who are executing the restoration based on permaculture principles. We hope to have workshops at EBTL soon, share learnings, & provide help to anyone attempting similar projects across the country.
